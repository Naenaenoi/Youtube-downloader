HOW TO INSTALL??????!~!!!!!!!11!

1: install python from the "Quick start" folder in this file

2: Make sure to check the box "Save python to PATH" in order for the next steps to work

3: install customtkinter and pytube using the commands (using command prompt) "pip install customtkinter" and "pip install pytube"

4: either run YTD directly or get a little fancy and make a .bat file to run it for you.



Important notes:

Your videos and audio files will be downloaded in their respective folders in 
THIS file. Not your normal video/audio/download folders (idk how to make python do that yet)
the .pyw file just removes the black terminal box behind the program on Windows (.pyw is windows specific and might mess up on other operating systems)
